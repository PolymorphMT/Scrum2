        <h2>What We Have On</h2>
        <p>
            Our club runs various activities during the week and if you are a member you can take part
            in them. The location of these activities is normally at our club but we sometimes will go somewhere
            else for the quiz like a pub or the cinema.
            <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Film Discussion - Here we like to talk about the latest films and get everyone's opinion on them.
                We also decide what the club does during the week like what movies to marathon and what films to watch
                at the cinema.</li>
            <li>Movie Marathon - This day is great as we spend the whole day watching films, this can include
                a whole series of films.</li>
            <li>Movie Quiz Night - On quiz night we will have night where we run a little quiz where the members
            can win small prizes.</li>
            <li>Cinema - On monday we will discuss what film we will watch at the cinema on saturday.</li>
        </ul>
